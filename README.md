## Introduction
CS50P is a comprehensive introduction to programming using Python, offered by Harvard University. The course covers fundamental concepts in computer science, algorithms, data structures, and various Python programming techniques.

## Course Objectives
- Master the basics of Python programming.
- Understand and implement algorithms and data structures.
- Develop problem-solving skills using Python.
- Complete weekly problem sets and a final project.
- Learn to test code using tools like `pytest`.

## Progress Tracker
| Week | Topic                             | Problem Sets/Notes                                                  |
|------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Functions, Variables, and Loops   | Completed problem set 1. Learned about basic Python syntax.          |
| 2    | Conditionals                      | Explored conditionals and logical operators.                         |
| 3    | Loops and Iterations              | Practiced loops and iteration patterns.                              |
| 4    | Data Structures                   | Worked with lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.                   |
| 5    | Object-Oriented Programming       | Implemented classes and objects in Python.                           |
| 6    | File I/O and Exceptions           | Learned to read from and write to files, and handle exceptions.      |
| 7    | Testing and Debugging             | Gained experience with `pytest` and debugging tools.                 |
| 8    | Final Project Development         | Started working on the final project, integrating multiple concepts. |

<!--## Projects
- **Voting Website:** Developed a voting website using Flask and HTML.
- **Snakes Hash Identifier:** Created a tool to identify different types of hashes used for data encryption.
- **Website Cloner:** Built a Chrome extension that clones websites, including basic HTML and JavaScript.-->

- [Python Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- [Flask Documentation](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/)

## Final Project
For the final project, I am developing a Python program that meets the course's specific requirements. The project involves creating a tool or application with a main function and at least three additional functions. I am also required to use `pytest` for testing and submit a video presentation along with a README.md file. The deadline for the final submission is January 1, 2025.

## Future Plans
- **Advanced Python Topics:** Explore more advanced Python topics like concurrency, multiprocessing, and async programming.
- **Open-Source Contribution:** Contribute to Python-based open-source projects.
- **Machine Learning:** Apply Python skills to machine learning projects using libraries like PyTorch.
